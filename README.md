# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Next Steps for Full Functionality

The application currently uses client-side mocks and browser localStorage for data persistence and interactivity for many features. This provides a realistic prototype of the user experience. A foundational `schema.sql` file has been provided as a starting point for database design.

To evolve this into a full-stack application with permanent, multi-user data and real-time features, the next major development phase would involve:

*   **Database Implementation**:
    *   Choose a SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., Firebase Firestore, MongoDB).
    *   Set up the database instance and apply the schema (if SQL-based, using the provided `schema.sql` as a starting point and refining it).
*   **Backend Development**:
    *   Setting up a backend server (e.g., using Next.js API Routes/Route Handlers, or a dedicated backend framework like Express.js, NestJS, Node.js with a chosen ORM like Prisma or TypeORM).
    *   Building out API endpoints for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to users, medicines, services, appointments, prescriptions, forum posts, comments, support groups, orders, payments, etc.
*   **User Authentication & Authorization**:
    *   Implementing a secure authentication system (e.g., Firebase Authentication, NextAuth.js, or custom JWT-based auth) to replace the current `localStorage` mock.
    *   Managing user roles and permissions on the server-side, ensuring users can only access and modify data they are authorized for.
*   **API Implementation (Detailed)**:
    *   **User Management**: APIs for registration, login, profile updates (including image uploads to a proper storage service), password management, role assignments.
    *   **Medicine Catalog & Inventory**: APIs for administrators to manage medicine stock (CRUD), and for users to browse and view medicine details.
    *   **Medicine Orders**: APIs for creating orders, managing cart state (server-side), processing payments (integration with payment gateways), and tracking order status.
    *   **Medical Test Information & Booking**: APIs for managing test listings and for users to book tests (potentially linking to appointments or orders).
    *   **Appointment Scheduling**: APIs for doctors to set availability, for patients to book appointments, and for managing appointment statuses (confirmed, cancelled, completed).
    *   **Prescriptions**: APIs for doctors to create and manage prescriptions, and for patients to view their prescriptions.
    *   **Community Forums**: APIs for creating, viewing, liking posts, and adding/viewing comments.
    *   **Support Groups**: APIs for creating groups, managing membership (join requests, approvals), posting in groups, and liking group posts.
*   **Real-time Features**:
    *   Integrating services or infrastructure for real-time communication (e.g., WebSockets, WebRTC, Firebase Realtime Database/Firestore listeners) for the Online Consultation feature, live chat in support groups, and real-time notifications.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration**:
    *   Connecting with a real payment provider (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, or local Rwandan payment gateways like MoMo) to handle actual financial transactions. The current payment page is a UI mock.
*   **Third-Party Service Integrations**:
    *   Setting up services for sending real verification codes for phone/email (e.g., Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email).
    *   Implementing secure file/image storage (e.g., Firebase Storage, AWS S3, Cloudinary) for user profile pictures, symptom images, group banners, etc.
*   **AI Feature Integration**:
    *   The existing Genkit flows for AI features (Symptom Analyzer, Medical FAQ, Test Yourself) can be called from your backend to keep AI logic centralized and secure, rather than directly from the client in a production scenario.
*   **Deployment**:
    *   Configuring and deploying both the frontend (Next.js app) and the backend services to a suitable hosting environment (e.g., Firebase Hosting with Cloud Functions/App Hosting, Vercel, AWS Amplify, Google Cloud Run, etc.).

This project provides a solid frontend foundation. The UI elements and client-side logic for features are designed to be adaptable to a real backend API. The transition involves replacing `localStorage` calls with API requests and managing state based on server responses.
