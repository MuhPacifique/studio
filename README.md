# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Next Steps for Full Functionality

The application currently uses client-side mocks and browser localStorage for data persistence and interactivity for many features. This provides a realistic prototype of the user experience.

To evolve this into a full-stack application with permanent, multi-user data and real-time features, the next major development phase would involve:

*   **Backend Development**:
    *   Setting up a backend server (e.g., using Next.js API Routes/Route Handlers, or a dedicated backend framework like Express.js, NestJS, etc.).
    *   Choosing and integrating a robust database (e.g., Firebase Firestore, Supabase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for persistent data storage.
*   **User Authentication & Authorization**:
    *   Implementing a secure authentication system (e.g., Firebase Authentication, NextAuth.js, or custom JWT-based auth).
    *   Managing user roles and permissions on the server-side.
*   **API Implementation**:
    *   Building RESTful or GraphQL APIs for all core features:
        *   User management (profiles, roles).
        *   Medicine catalog, inventory, and ordering.
        *   Medical test information and booking.
        *   Appointment scheduling and management.
        *   Prescription creation and management.
        *   Community forum posts and comments.
        *   Support group management and interactions.
*   **Real-time Features**:
    *   Integrating services or infrastructure for real-time communication (e.g., WebSockets, WebRTC) for the Online Consultation feature.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration**:
    *   Connecting with a real payment provider (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, or local Rwandan payment gateways) to handle actual financial transactions for medicine orders and services.
*   **Third-Party Service Integrations**:
    *   Setting up services for sending real verification codes (e.g., Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email).
    *   Implementing secure file/image storage for user uploads (e.g., Firebase Storage, AWS S3, Cloudinary).
*   **Deployment**:
    *   Configuring and deploying both the frontend and backend to a suitable hosting environment.

This project provides a solid frontend foundation. The existing Genkit flows for AI features can be called from your future backend to keep AI logic centralized.
