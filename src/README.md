# Firebase Studio - MediServe Hub Prototype

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio, prototyped as MediServe Hub.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Application Architecture Overview

This application is currently a **frontend prototype**. It simulates user interactions and data persistence using client-side JavaScript and browser features (like UI state management). **It does not have a functional backend or database connected.**

The `schema.sql` file provides a foundational database design, and `src/server.js` is a conceptual placeholder for what a Node.js/Express.js backend might look like. These are for future development guidance.

**All data interactions are currently mocked or ephemeral within the user's browser session.** For example:
*   User "authentication" is simulated for UI flow but does not represent secure login.
*   "Saving" data (like prescriptions, appointments, forum posts, cart items) updates the UI state or uses temporary mock arrays, but this data is not permanently stored or shared across users/sessions.
*   AI features (Symptom Analyzer, FAQ, Test Yourself) call actual Genkit flows, but the input/output is not persisted in a user-specific way unless explicitly shown in the UI for that session.

## Next Steps for Full-Stack Functionality

To evolve this into a full-stack application with permanent, multi-user data and real-time features, the next major development phase would involve:

*   **Backend Development (e.g., using Node.js, Express.js, or Next.js API Routes/Route Handlers)**:
    *   Setting up a backend server.
    *   Implementing all API endpoints outlined conceptually in `src/server.js`.
    *   Connecting these endpoints to a chosen database system.
*   **Database Implementation**:
    *   Choose a SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL based on the provided `schema.sql`) or a NoSQL database (e.g., Firebase Firestore, MongoDB).
    *   Set up the database instance, apply the schema (if SQL-based), and write data access logic (e.g., using an ORM like Prisma or TypeORM, or raw SQL queries).
*   **User Authentication & Authorization**:
    *   Implement a secure authentication system (e.g., Firebase Authentication, NextAuth.js, or custom JWT-based auth) to replace the current UI-only simulation.
    *   Manage user roles and permissions on the server-side, ensuring users can only access and modify data they are authorized for.
*   **API Implementation (Detailed for each feature)**:
    *   Replace all client-side data mocks with API calls to the backend.
    *   **User Management**: APIs for registration, login, profile updates (including image uploads to a proper storage service), password management, role assignments.
    *   **Medicine Catalog & Inventory**: APIs for administrators to manage medicine stock (CRUD), and for users to browse and view medicine details.
    *   **Medicine Orders & Cart**: APIs for managing server-side cart state, creating orders, processing payments (integration with payment gateways), and tracking order status.
    *   **Medical Test Information & Booking**: APIs for managing test listings and for users to book tests.
    *   **Appointment Scheduling**: APIs for doctors to set availability, for patients to book appointments, and for managing appointment statuses.
    *   **Prescriptions**: APIs for doctors to create and manage prescriptions, and for patients to view their prescriptions.
    *   **Community Forums & Support Groups**: APIs for creating/managing posts, comments, groups, memberships, likes, etc., with proper authorization.
*   **Real-time Features**:
    *   Integrating services or infrastructure for real-time communication (e.g., WebSockets, WebRTC, Firebase Realtime Database/Firestore listeners) for the Online Consultation feature, live chat, and notifications.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration**:
    *   Connecting with a real payment provider (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, or local Rwandan payment gateways) to handle actual financial transactions.
*   **Third-Party Service Integrations**:
    *   Setting up services for sending real verification codes (e.g., Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email).
    *   Implementing secure file/image storage (e.g., Firebase Storage, AWS S3, Cloudinary).
*   **AI Feature Integration (Backend-side)**:
    *   Genkit flows (Symptom Analyzer, Medical FAQ, Test Yourself) should ideally be called from your backend to keep AI logic centralized, secure, and potentially to log interactions or personalize responses based on user data.
*   **Deployment**:
    *   Configuring and deploying both the frontend (Next.js app) and the backend services to a suitable hosting environment (e.g., Firebase Hosting with Cloud Functions/App Hosting, Vercel, AWS Amplify, Google Cloud Run, etc.).

This prototype provides a solid frontend foundation. The transition to full-stack involves replacing all client-side data management and simulated interactions with robust, secure, and scalable backend services.
